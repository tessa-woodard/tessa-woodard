### Hey, Iâ€™m Tessa! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a **UI/UX Front-End Developer** whoâ€™s all about creating fun, impactful designs that make people go, "**Hey, thatâ€™s awesome!**" After graduating from Devmountain in 2020, Iâ€™ve been diving into web development with a focus on **clean**, **user-friendly** interfaces.

My journey has been pretty wild:  
- From creating comfy (but questionable) footwear websites at **Crocs**  
- To now working on sleek **car dealership sites** at **DealerOn** â€” talk about variety!

Iâ€™m not limited to any one industry. Whether itâ€™s shoes, cars, or something totally different, Iâ€™m always excited to build something **creative** and **impactful**. Wherever life takes me, Iâ€™m all in for designing things that **stand out**.
