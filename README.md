### Hey, Iâ€™m Tessa! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a **UI/UX Front-End Developer** whoâ€™s all about creating fun, impactful designs that make people go, "**Hey, thatâ€™s awesome!**" After graduating from Devmountain in 2020, Iâ€™ve been diving into web development with a focus on **clean**, **user-friendly** interfaces.

My journey has been pretty wild:
- Working on sleek **car dealership sites** at **DealerOn** â€” talk about variety!  
- From creating comfy (but questionable) footwear websites at **Crocs**  
- Diving into the world of **decentralized identity**, **verifiable credentials**, and **QR codes** at **Indicio.tech** â€” helping secure everything from **biometric authentication** to **digital travel credentials**  
- Working with **Flylance**, where I helped build a site for a **waste management company** â€” yeah, Iâ€™m the person who made sure trash truck drivers had a smooth route planning experience!

Iâ€™m not limited to any one industry. Whether itâ€™s shoes, cars, or something totally different, Iâ€™m always excited to build something **creative** and **impactful**. Wherever life takes me, Iâ€™m all in for designing things that **stand out**.
