I’m a **UI/UX Front-End Developer** who’s all about creating fun, impactful designs that make people go, "**Hey, that’s awesome!**" After graduating from Devmountain in 2020, I’ve been diving into web development with a focus on **clean**, **user-friendly** interfaces.

My journey has been pretty wild:
- Designing sleek **car dealership websites** at **DealerOn** — always something new and exciting!  
- From creating comfy (but questionable) footwear websites at **Crocs**  
- Diving into the world of **decentralized identity**, **verifiable credentials**, and **QR codes** at **Indicio.tech** — helping secure everything from **biometric authentication** to **digital travel credentials**  
- Working with **Flylance**, where I helped build a site for a **waste management company** — yeah, I’m the person who made sure trash truck drivers had a smooth route planning experience!

I’m not limited to any one industry. Whether it’s shoes, cars, or something totally different, I’m always excited to build something **creative** and **impactful**. Wherever life takes me, I’m all in for designing things that **stand out**.
